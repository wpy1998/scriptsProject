The revision will continue to set limitations on six categories of lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers. The important modifications are listed as follows:  ;
1.	The scope of this rule will be extended from electronic information product to electrical and electronic product, thus the title of the rule will be revised as the Administration on the Control of Pollution Caused by Electrical and Electronic Products. The definition of electrical and electronic product means the equipment and its supporting products with a voltage rating not exceeding 1500 volts for alternating current and 1000 volts for direct current. ;
 ;
2.	In order to encourage producers to substitute and reduce the use of toxic and hazardous substances, the title of Key Management Catalogue for the Control of Pollution caused by Electronic Information Products will be revised as Management Catalogue of Standard-Reaching for the Control of Pollution caused by Electrical and Electronic Products. ;
 ;
3.	The former rule requires the electronic information products listed in the Key Catalogue should be subject to compulsory product certification, and it will be revised as  the electrical and electronic products listed in the Management Catalogue will be subject to certification according to the national certification system for the control of pollution caused by electrical and electronic product. ;
